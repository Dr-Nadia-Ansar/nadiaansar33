## 👋 Hi, I'm Nadia Ansar  
Ph.D. Researcher (Jamia Hamdard University, India)  
Experienced in **Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Cybersecurity for IoT and Network Systems**  

---

### About Me
- Developed **SARIM (Secure Advanced Risk Intelligence Model)** — a multi-stage AI-driven IoT intrusion detection framework combining:
  - **RF–BiLSTM hybrid detection** for known attacks  
  - **Calibrated Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL-IDS)** for detecting unseen or zero-day threats  
  - **Semantic-preserving compression** for secure deployment in bandwidth-limited IoT environments  
- Skilled in **Machine Learning, Deep Learning (LSTM, BiLSTM), and Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL)** applied to cybersecurity.  
- Research expertise in **AI-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**, **IoT Security**, and **Network Threat Modelling**.  
- Currently transitioning toward **post-doctoral research** focused on **protocol-level security by design** —  
  proposing **SLTP (Secure Lightweight Transport Protocol)**, a next-generation Internet transport layer with built-in encryption, authentication, and integrity.  
- Open to collaborations in **AI for Cybersecurity, Secure Protocol Design, and Post-Quantum Cryptography**

### Motivation
My Ph.D. journey focused on building **intelligent, adaptive, and resource-aware IoT security systems** using AI and ML.  
Through the development of **SARIM**, I realized that true cyber resilience requires *security to be embedded at the protocol level itself*, not just detected after the fact.  
This realization fuels my post-doctoral vision — the creation of **SLTP**, a *secure-by-default transport-layer protocol* that integrates encryption and trust directly into the Internet’s communication architecture.  
In essence, my research evolves from *AI-driven intrusion detection* to *architectural, preventive security by design.*
